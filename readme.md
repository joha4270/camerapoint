In theory this is a project that will allow a webcamera to find its position in 3d space, based on some visible markings. 

To do so, it identifies markings with its camera, finds "target circles" and based on their size and point on screen, calculates position.

Right now it displays images from a hardcoded (probably IP camera but not quite sure what protocol my phone uses) image source to the screen in a semi efficient manner.
